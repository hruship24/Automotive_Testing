Test-Driven Development (TDD) for 1st Sprint:

User Registration Feature:
1. Test Case 1: Valid Username Format
   - Description: Verify that the username field accepts alphabets and numbers, starting with an alphabet.
   - Steps:
     1. Enter a valid username containing alphabets and numbers.
     2. Ensure the username starts with an alphabet.
   - Expected Result: The system should accept the valid username format without any error.

2. Test Case 2: Password Complexity
   - Description: Ensure that the password meets complexity requirements.
   - Steps:
     1. Enter a password with at least 8 characters.
     2. Include at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, and one number.
   - Expected Result: The system should accept the password that meets the complexity criteria.

3. Test Case 3: Email Validation
   - Description: Validate the email format entered during registration.
   - Steps:
     1. Enter a valid email address with the correct format (e.g., example@email.com).
     2. Ensure the email format follows standard conventions.
   - Expected Result: The system should accept the valid email format and proceed with registration.

4. Test Case 4: Error Handling for Invalid Inputs
   - Description: Check the system's response to invalid inputs during registration.
   - Steps:
     1. Enter invalid data in the username, password, or email fields.
     2. Attempt to submit the registration form.
   - Expected Result: The system should display appropriate error messages for each invalid input, guiding the user to correct the mistakes.

5. Test Case 5: Unique Username Constraint
   - Description: Validate that each username entered during registration is unique.
   - Steps:
     1. Attempt to register with a username that already exists in the system.
     2. Submit the registration form.
   - Expected Result: The system should reject the registration attempt and prompt the user to choose a different username.

Login Feature:
1. Test Case 6: Valid Login Credentials
   - Description: Verify that users can log in successfully with valid credentials.
   - Steps:
     1. Enter a registered username and password.
     2. Click on the login button.
   - Expected Result: The system should authenticate the user and redirect them to the dashboard or home page.

2. Test Case 7: Invalid Login Credentials
   - Description: Test the system's response to invalid login attempts.
   - Steps:
     1. Enter an incorrect username or password.
     2. Attempt to log in.
   - Expected Result: The system should display an error message indicating that the login credentials are invalid.

3. Test Case 8: Remember Me Functionality
   - Description: Check if the "Remember Me" option keeps the user logged in across sessions.
   - Steps:
     1. Check the "Remember Me" checkbox during login.
     2. Log in and close the browser.
     3. Reopen the browser and navigate to the login page.
   - Expected Result: The system should automatically log in the user without requiring them to enter credentials again.

Overall Test Strategy:
- Implement automated unit tests for each functionality using a testing framework such as JUnit or NUnit.
- Conduct manual testing to ensure the user interface behaves as expected and adheres to usability standards.
- Collaborate with stakeholders to validate test cases and ensure comprehensive coverage of user registration and login features.

Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD):
- Integrate testing into the CI/CD pipeline to automate testing and ensure consistent quality across releases.
- Monitor test results and address any failures promptly to maintain the reliability of the application.
