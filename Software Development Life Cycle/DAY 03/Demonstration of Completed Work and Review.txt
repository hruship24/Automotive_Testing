Demonstration of Completed Work (Completed User Stories):
- We've successfully implemented the user registration feature, allowing users to create accounts using their email and password securely. [Stakeholder Feedback: Confirm if additional registration methods are required (e.g., social media logins) and if the process aligns with data privacy regulations.]
- The login functionality has been developed, enabling registered users to access their accounts efficiently. [Stakeholder Feedback: Verify if password recovery options are available and if the login process meets security standards.]
- Error handling mechanisms have been integrated to assist users in case of mistakes during registration and login processes. [Stakeholder Feedback: Discuss the clarity and effectiveness of error messages to ensure a smooth user experience.]

In Progress User Stories:
- Enhancements to the user interface design for improved aesthetics and usability. (50% complete, refining layout and color scheme). [Stakeholder Feedback: Seek input on design preferences and accessibility considerations.]
- Implementation of additional security measures, such as CAPTCHA verification, to prevent unauthorized access. (30% complete, researching best practices). [Stakeholder Feedback: Address any concerns regarding user data protection and compliance with security standards.]
