There are two types of questions.
1. Direct questions which means the questions which begin with Wh & H forms.
2. Indirect questions which means the questions which begin with Helping verbs viz. am, is, are, was, were, do, does, did, have, has, had, will, would, can, could etc. This type of question is also called Yes/No Type Question. 
Did they attend the client’s meet?
Are you sending the files to me now?
Will he come tomorrow?
Has she updated the time sheet?
Have the associates been waiting for the new update?
 
If you want to convert the above sentences into direct questions, then you must add question words to them at the beginning. But some direct questions also begin with prepositions like to, on, by, at etc. They can also appear at the end of the sentences.
Examples follow:
What, when, where, which, who, whom, whose, why & How….
 
To whom are you sending the files now?/ who are you sending the files to?
By what time can I expect them in office tomorrow?
What will your CEO be advising his team at this time tomorrow?
